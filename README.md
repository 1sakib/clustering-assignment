# CPS803 Pre-processing and Clustering Assignment
This assignment applies machine learning pre-processing and clustering techniques to the “E-shop Clothing 2008 clickstream dataset”,
an online browsing dataset containing user interactions with a fashion retail website. 
This dataset is particularly valuable because it captures real-world consumer behavior,
including products viewed, what users tend to click on, and how different factors affect a customer staying or leaving an e-store site.
